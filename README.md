# KSP Flight Plan: Proof-of-Concept

A flight planning utility for Kerbal Space Program. This current program is a command-line utility that takes craft delta-v input and returns if a mission is possible or not.

I plan for this to later become a mod, but for now, a proof-of-concept is all that is guarenteed.

DISCLAIMER: IS VERY WIP! PROGRAM FUNCTIONALITY IS VERY LIMITED AND BUGGY!
